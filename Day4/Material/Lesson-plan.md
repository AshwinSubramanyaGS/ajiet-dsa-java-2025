Of course! Here is a comprehensive and intensive 6-hour training plan for freshers, designed to take them from the basics of Dynamic Arrays and Linked Lists to solving competitive programming problems.

The plan is structured to be highly interactive, with a focus on hands-on coding.

### **Training Plan: Mastering Dynamic Arrays & Linked Lists for Competitive Programming**

**Target Audience:** Freshers (New to Data Structures)
**Duration:** 6 Hours (Including Breaks)
**Prerequisites:** Basic knowledge of any programming language (C++/Java/Python), and fundamental concepts of pointers/object references.

### **Hour 1: Foundation & Dynamic Arrays**

**Goal:** Understand the limitations of static arrays and how Dynamic Arrays solve them.

| Time | Topic | Details | Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **0:00 - 0:15** | **Introduction & The "Array" Problem** | - Quick intro to the trainer and agenda. <br>- Recap of static arrays: Fixed size, memory allocation. <br>- The problem: What if we don't know the size in advance? Wasted space vs. insufficient space. | Lecture, Q&A |
| **0:15 - 0:45** | **Dynamic Arrays Deep Dive** | - Concept: How a dynamic array works (e.g., `std::vector` in C++, `ArrayList` in Java, `list` in Python). <br>- **Amortized Analysis:** The "double-up" strategy when capacity is full. Why appending is O(1) on average. <br>- Key Operations: `push_back`/`add` (O(1) am.), random access (O(1)), insertion/deletion in the middle (O(n)). | Live coding demonstration of resizing logic. Visual diagram of the process. |
| **0:45 - 1:00** | **Hands-On Practice** | - Simple problems to build familiarity. <br> 1. Create a dynamic array and add elements until it triggers a resize (print capacity vs. size). <br> 2. Reverse a dynamic array in-place. <br> 3. Remove all even numbers from a dynamic array. | Participants code along in their own IDE. |

### **Hour 2: Introduction to Linked Lists**

**Goal:** Understand the core concept of a node and how Linked Lists are structured in memory.

| Time | Topic | Details | Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1:00 - 1:30** | **Singly Linked List (SLL)** | - Concept: A node (data + pointer to next node). <br>- Memory allocation: Non-contiguous vs. arrays. <br>- Visualizing the "chain" of nodes. <br>- Operations: <br>  - Traversal (O(n)) <br>  - Insertion at head (O(1)) <br>  - Insertion at tail (O(n) without tail pointer, O(1) with) <br>  - Deletion of head (O(1)) <br>  - Deletion by value (O(n)) | Code the `Node` class and a simple `LinkedList` class with a `head` pointer. Live code insertion at head. |
| **1:30 - 1:50** | **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** | - Concept: A node (data + next pointer + prev pointer). <br>- Advantages: Can traverse backwards, deletion of a known node is O(1). <br>- Disadvantages: More memory overhead. | Code the `DLLNode` class. Show how deletion becomes easier. |
| **1:50 - 2:00** | **Comparison: Arrays vs. Linked Lists** | - Quick summary table: <br> - **Access:** Array (O(1)) vs. LL (O(n)) <br> - **Insert/Delete at head:** Array (O(n)) vs. LL (O(1)) <br> - **Memory:** Array (contiguous, fixed) vs. LL (fragmented, dynamic) | Interactive discussion: "When would you use a Linked List over an Array?" |

### **Hour 3: Core Linked List Manipulations**

**Goal:** Master the fundamental algorithms for manipulating Linked Lists.

| Time | Topic | Details | Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **2:00 - 2:15** | **BREAK** | | |
| **2:15 - 2:45** | **Essential Traversal Techniques** | - **Problem 1: Find the Middle Node** (Tortoise and Hare, Floyd's Cycle-Finding algorithm intro). <br>- **Problem 2: Reverse a Linked List** (Iterative method with `prev`, `curr`, `next`). This is a **must-know**. | Live coding with detailed step-by-step explanation. Participants code along. |
| **2:45 - 3:00** | **Deletion Techniques** | - **Problem 3: Delete a node given only a pointer to it** (The "copy-next-node's-value" trick for SLL). <br>- **Problem 4: Remove the N-th node from the end** (Two-pointer technique: move first pointer `n` steps ahead, then move both). | Live coding. Emphasize the "dummy node" technique to handle edge cases like deleting the head. |

### **Hour 4: Problem Solving - Part 1 (Beginner/Intermediate)**

**Goal:** Apply the learned techniques to solve common competitive problems.

| Time | Topic | Details | Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **3:00 - 3:45** | **Guided Problem Solving** | - **Problem 5: Detect a Cycle in a Linked List** (Floyd's Cycle-Finding algorithm in detail). <br>- **Problem 6: Find the starting point of the cycle** (Mathematical intuition + code). <br>- **Problem 7: Check if a Linked List is a Palindrome** (Middle + Reverse second half + Compare). | Trainer solves one problem, explaining the thought process. Participants attempt the next one with hints. |
| **3:45 - 4:00** | **Q&A and Recap** | - Clarify doubts from the first half. <br>- Quick recap of key concepts and techniques so far. | Interactive Session |

### **Hour 5: Problem Solving - Part 2 (Intermediate/Advanced)**

**Goal:** Tackle more complex problems that require a combination of techniques.

| Time | Topic | Details | Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **4:00 - 4:15** | **BREAK** | | |
| **4:15 - 5:00** | **Advanced Manipulations** | - **Problem 8: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists** (Classic merge step from Merge Sort). <br>- **Problem 9: Add Two Numbers represented by Linked Lists** (Digits stored in reverse order). <br>- **Problem 10: Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List** (A good DFS/recursion application). | Trainer provides the problem statement and a high-level approach. Participants try to code for 15 mins, then a collaborative code review. |

### **Hour 6: Application & Conclusion**

**Goal:** See how these data structures are used in real-world scenarios and wrap up.

| Time | Topic | Details | Activity |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **5:00 - 5:30** | **Real-World Applications & Competitive Tips** | - **Dynamic Arrays:** Where are they used? (Basically everywhere where a resizable list is needed). <br>- **Linked Lists:** Browser history (back/forward), MRU/LRU Caches (a brief intro to `LRUCache` problem), Undo functionality. <br>- **Competitive Tips:** <br>  - Always check for `nullptr`/`None`/`null`. <br>  - Use a **Dummy Node** to simplify head operations. <br>  - Draw the linked list on paper/whiteboard before coding! | Discussion, sharing links to important resources (GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode). |
| **5:30 - 5:55** | **Final Challenge Problem** | - **Problem 11: Copy List with Random Pointer** (A classic problem that combines hashing and linked list traversal). <br>- This is a tough one. Walk through the 3-step solution: 1. Create interweaved list. 2. Assign random pointers. 3. Separate the lists. | Collaborative solving. Trainer leads the discussion. |
| **5:55 - 6:00** | **Wrap-up & Next Steps** | - Summary of key takeaways. <br>- Provide a list of recommended problems for practice. <br>- Encourage continuous learning. | |
